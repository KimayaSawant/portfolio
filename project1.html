      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>
        A real-time multiplayer chess platform that allows users to play interactive chess games with opponents online. The platform ensures instant updates to the game state, creating a seamless and responsive playing experience for users.
      </p>
      <h2>What was this built with?</h2>
      <p>
        This project uses Django for a robust backend, WebSockets for real-time communication, and JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the frontend.
      </p>
      <h2>What were the biggest challenges?</h2>
      <p>
        - Implementing WebSocket communication for real-time updates while ensuring data consistency in the game state.<br>
        - Managing user interactions dynamically, including turn-based updates and validating moves.<br>
        - Designing an intuitive and responsive interface to make the game engaging for all users.
      </p>
      <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
      <p>
        This project enhanced my understanding of real-time communication using WebSockets and reinforced my skills in backend development with Django. It also helped me improve my UI/UX design abilities to deliver a better user experience.
