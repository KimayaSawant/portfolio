    <h1>Food Classifier and Calorie Counter</h1>
    <div class="project-description">
      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>
        A machine learning web application that uses image recognition and computer vision to classify food types and calculate their nutritional content. This tool helps users track their calorie intake efficiently.
      </p>
      <h2>What was this built with?</h2>
      <p>
        This project leverages Python for backend logic, TensorFlow for machine learning, HTML and CSS for frontend design, and MySQL for database management.
      </p>
      <h2>What were the biggest challenges?</h2>
      <p>
        - Building an accurate image recognition model for classifying food items.<br>
        - Reducing execution time while maintaining high accuracy.<br>
        - Designing a user-friendly interface for non-technical users to interact with the application.
      </p>
      <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
      <p>
        I gained experience in applying computer vision and machine learning techniques to practical problems. Additionally, I learned the importance of optimizing execution time and collaborating effectively in a team environment.
