    <h1>Enhanced Vision-Based Detection System</h1>
    <div class="project-description">
      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>
        A real-time detection system to enhance pedestrian safety at urban crosswalks. The system identifies pedestrians using advanced machine vision and anonymizes individuals to protect privacy.
      </p>
      <h2>What was this built with?</h2>
      <p>
        The project leverages NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for real-time processing, OpenCV for computer vision tasks, CUDA for GPU acceleration, and the YOLO deep learning model for detection.
      </p>
      <h2>What were the biggest challenges?</h2>
      <p>
        - Balancing real-time processing with high accuracy in detection.<br>
        - Ensuring privacy protection while handling video data.<br>
        - Deploying the system on constrained hardware like Jetson Orin Nano.
      </p>
      <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
      <p>
        This project expanded my knowledge of computer vision, deep learning, and edge computing. It taught me how to design and optimize solutions for real-time applications in constrained environments.
