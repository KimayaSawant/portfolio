      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>
        Petstagram is a dynamic social media app designed for pet enthusiasts. The app allows users to share photos, explore pet-related content, and interact with other pet lovers in real-time. Itâ€™s a space for pet owners to connect and showcase their furry friends.
      </p>
      <h2>What was this built with?</h2>
      <p>
        The project was built using Flutter for a seamless cross-platform mobile experience. Firebase was used for real-time database management, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provided scalable cloud storage for user-generated content.
      </p>
      <h2>What were the biggest challenges?</h2>
      <p>
        - Ensuring real-time updates for a smooth user experience.<br>
        - Managing and scaling cloud storage to handle large volumes of media uploads.<br>
        - Designing an intuitive UI/UX that appeals to a diverse audience of pet enthusiasts.
      </p>
      <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
      <p>
        This project enhanced my understanding of mobile app development with Flutter. I also learned about integrating Firebase and GCP for scalable backend solutions. Additionally, I gained experience in designing engaging user interfaces for a social media application.
